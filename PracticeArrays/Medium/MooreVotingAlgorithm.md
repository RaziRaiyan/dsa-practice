Let's deeply understand **Moore's Voting Algorithm** step by step.

## 💡 **Intuition of Moore’s Voting Algorithm:**

**Key Insight**:  
If an element occurs more than ⌊n/2⌋ times in an array, it means this element appears **more frequently** than **all other elements combined**.

Thus, we can leverage the following idea:

- Whenever we pair two **different** elements, we can discard them, as they don't affect the majority status of the remaining array.
- After discarding pairs, the element that remains (or the candidate we track) must be the majority element.

---

## 🔍 **Algorithm Steps:**

The algorithm is executed in **two main steps**:

### Step 1: Finding a Candidate
- Initialize two variables:
  - `candidate` (initially undefined or the first element)
  - `count = 0`
- Traverse through the array:
  - If `count = 0`, set `candidate` to the current element.
  - If the current element equals `candidate`, increment `count`.
  - Else, decrement `count`.

This way, when the loop ends, you have a candidate that might be the majority element.

### Step 2: Verifying Candidate (Optional here)
- Usually, we need a second traversal to confirm if the candidate is actually majority. But since your problem guarantees existence, you can directly return the candidate.

## 🚀 **Why does it work? (Critical Intuition)**

Imagine the algorithm as a **battle between the majority and minority elements**:

- When `candidate` matches the current number, we increment `count`—this is like the candidate **gaining support**.
- When they differ, we decrement `count`—like two different elements cancelling each other out.

Since the majority element occurs more frequently, even after being "cancelled out" by minority elements multiple times, it will **still persist**, leaving us with the correct candidate.

## 🧩 **Example & Dry Run**

Consider the array:

```
[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

| Step | Element | Candidate | Count | Action                                    |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0    | -       | None      | 0     | Initialize                                |
| 1    | 2       | 2         | 1     | Set candidate=2, count=1                  |
| 2    | 2       | 2         | 2     | Same candidate, increment                 |
| 3    | 1       | 2         | 1     | Different, decrement                      |
| 4    | 1       | 2         | 0     | Different, decrement to zero              |
| 5    | 1       | 1         | 1     | count=0, set new candidate=1              |
| 6    | 2       | 1         | 0     | Different, decrement to zero              |
| 7    | 2       | 2         | 1     | count=0, set new candidate=2              |

The final candidate is **2**, which is correct!

## 🎯 **Second Dry Run Example:**

Array:
```
[3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
```

| Step | Element | Candidate | Count | Action                                    |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0    | -       | None      | 0     | Initialize                                |
| 1    | 3       | 3         | 1     | Set candidate=3, count=1                  |
| 2    | 3       | 3         | 2     | Same candidate, increment                 |
| 3    | 4       | 3         | 1     | Different, decrement                      |
| 4    | 2       | 3         | 0     | Different, decrement to zero              |
| 5    | 4       | 4         | 1     | count=0, set new candidate=4              |
| 6    | 4       | 4         | 2     | Same candidate, increment                 |
| 7    | 2       | 4         | 1     | Different, decrement                      |
| 8    | 4       | 4         | 2     | Same candidate, increment                 |
| 9    | 4       | 4         | 3     | Same candidate, increment                 |

The final candidate is **4**, which is indeed the majority.

## 🧑‍💻 **Pseudocode of Moore’s Voting Algorithm**

```javascript
function findMajorityElement(nums) {
    let count = 0, candidate;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (count === 0) {
            candidate = num; // new candidate found
        }
        count += (num === candidate) ? 1 : -1;
    }
    
    return candidate; // candidate is guaranteed to be majority here
}
```

## 📌 **Complexity Analysis**

| Metric         | Complexity | Reasoning                       |
|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| Time           | `O(n)`     | Single pass through the array   |
| Space          | `O(1)`     | Only a few variables needed     |

This makes Moore’s algorithm highly efficient and ideal for this type of majority element problem.

## 🔖 **Final Notes**

- Moore's Voting Algorithm cleverly exploits the given guarantee that the majority exists and appears more than n/2 times.
- Its simplicity and efficiency (`O(n)` and `O(1)` space) make it the go-to solution for such problems.
